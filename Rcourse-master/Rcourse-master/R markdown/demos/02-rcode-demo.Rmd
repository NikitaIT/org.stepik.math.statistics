## Introduction

The data used in this study is taken from <http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data>.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
glacier <- read.csv("glacier.csv", na.strings = "..", comment.char = "#")
```

The data set contains `r nrow(glacier)` measurements of `r nlevels(glacier$GEO)` Canadian glacier mass balance, collected from `r min(glacier$Ref_Date)` till `r max(glacier$Ref_Date)`. Namely, the file includes these glaciers:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
levels(glacier$GEO)
```
